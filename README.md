From the paper of Karzanov and Khachiyan, an algorithm to generate random linear extensions
antichains1.txt to antichains5.txt: exhaustive lists of antichains of the power set of size 1 to 5
general_all_antichains_power_set: the code that generates antichains1.txt to antichains5.txt
total_tension: generation of antichains using the maximal tension (=jump) criterion
max jump with random values
relabelling method: method of random generation where we apply a relabelling at each step
stratification algo 5: extract layers in the spirit of the Dilworth theorem
